Setting up our own IDE (Course recommends PyCharm but I've used Visual Studio Code as it's mostly language agnostic so I can use it for learning other things later on if I stick with programming and don't pull my hair out.)

Creation of a Cofee machine application that goes through the process of asking the user what they'd like to drink from a selection of 3, looking up the resources in a dictionary and using the user input to check against the resources available and what the drink requires from another dictionary containing the name, cost, ingredients required. Then taking the payment from the user in US coins (Quarters,dimes etc) and returning the result of the exchange by adding the amount of the transaction to the application and reducing the available resources. 

The application also loops back and only exits on the user entering 'off' or reports the available resources (including total money) from 'report'
